Keeping track of your work is very important. These tools allow you to save your entire RHistory so you can comme back to earlier work easily.\cr
The files is saved into the specified directory under the subdirectory current date. The current timestamp is added to the info file so saving your work several time does not overwrite earlier saves. It works like save.rhistory, but here we use the track library.\cr
